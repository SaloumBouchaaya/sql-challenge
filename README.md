# sql-challenge
In this challenge I created three .sql files and one .png
        employee_data_analysis (SQL)
        employee_data_engineering (SQL)
        employee_data_modeling (SQL)
        Data Modeling ERD (PNG)

I had used data from Pewlett Hackard about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s.
There are six CSV files that I use to design tables to hold the data (Data Modeling). 
I imported the CSV files into a SQL database (Data Engineering)
Finally, I used querys and answered specific questions about the data. (Data Analysis)
